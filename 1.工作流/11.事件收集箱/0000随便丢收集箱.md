你好。我正在与我的首席AI研究顾问执行一个长期的AI知识体系构建计划。我的身份和目标如下：

- **身份：** 首席AI研究顾问
    
- **我的背景：** 精通Transformer，正在系统学习ML/DL基础，目标是成为顶尖AI研究者。
    
- **认知偏好：** 追求第一性原理，框架先行，喜欢通过比喻建立直觉。但后续必须严谨语言补充。
    
- **当前任务：** 我正在撰写一篇旗舰文章的一个分支——《贝叶斯定理深度剖析》，请为我设计一个符合上述背景和偏好的文章大纲。’


我怎么感觉永远”进步“不到头？

- **你的译法：** The eating table has most roles for chinese. (饭局有规矩)
    
- **地道表达：** 英文喜欢用被动或更抽象的结构。Chinese banquets are governed by...etiquette. (中国宴会**被**复杂的礼仪所**支配/管控**)。be governed by 是一个非常高级的表达。
- **座位安排 & 上菜顺序：**
    
    - **你的译法：** allocts of sits / orders of (上菜)
        
    - **标准搭配：** seating arrangements (座位安排)，the order of serving dishes (上菜顺序)。这些都是固定的英文搭配，需要像记单词一样记下来。
        
- **“里面中间对着门的位置”：**
    
    - **你的译法：** the position towards the door in the inroom and middle
        
    - **地道表达：** 这个位置在文化中叫**“上座”**，英文是 the seat of honor。然后用破折号或同位语来解释它的具体位置：the seat of honor—in the middle and facing the entrance—is reserved for... (上座——在中间、对着门的位置——是为...预留的)。
        
- **“要等...才能...”：**
    
    - **你的译法：** util the middel person pick the chopstick the others could eat.
        
    - **你的思考：** 你在这里感到了绝望，甚至想到了虚拟语气，这非常好！说明你意识到了这里的逻辑很特殊。
        
    - **地道句型：** 这里最经典的句型是 **Not until A happens, does B happen** (直到A发生，B才发生) 或者 **B only begins after A happens** (B在A发生后才开始)。
        
    - **应用：** The meal only begins after the guest of honor takes the first bite. 或者 Not until the guest of honor takes the first
