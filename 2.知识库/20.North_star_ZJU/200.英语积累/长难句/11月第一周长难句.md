This success, coupled with later research showing that memory itself is not genetically determined, led Ericsson  to conclude that the act of memorizing is more of a cognitive exercise than an intuitive one.
分析： This success  led Ericsson  to conclude.   是主句 coupled with research是success的修饰？这是什么修饰呢，一个逗号。   showing that...是reserch的修饰
v1:这样的成功，加上最新的研究表明记忆力并不由遗传决定，让Ericsson（有信心）推断，记忆的奥秘（艺术反应成，能力？我翻译成了奥秘）更多来自于认知性的训练 而不是纯粹的直觉
标准版：这一成功，再加上后来的研究表面记忆本身并非由基因决定，使得爱立信得出结论，记忆这一行为，与其说是一种直觉活动，不如说这是一项认知练习。
- lead sb to do 使得某人做某事
- the act of  doing sth 做某事这一行为本身
- more of A than B 与其说是B，不如说是A
- xx， coupled with xxx       - coupled with -> combined with (同义词)

```
This success, coupled with the finding that  memory itself is not genetically determined, convinced Ericsson that the act of memorizing  is not such an  intuitive ability as a cognitive skill. 

```

**"This initial success, combined with the later finding that memory is not genetically determined, prompted Ericsson to argue that the act of memorizing is not so much an innate talent as a trainable cognitive exercise."**

From the middle-class family perspective, much of this, understandably, looks far less like an opportunity to exercise more financial responsibility, and a good deal more like a frightening acceleration of the wholesale shift of financial risk onto their already overburdened shoulders.
分析： much of this looks for  less like an opportunity  and a good deal  是主句
acceleration of the wholesale shift of financial risk  是不是of修饰都是”就近原则“？ 
v1:  从中产家庭的视角来看，他们中的许多，都理所当然地少找一些锻炼财务责任的机会，而是在他们已经负担很多责任的情况下，多找一些更好的交易，他们有惊人速度完成全盘颠覆的财政风险。
- looks like less A and much more like B 看起来不那么像A而是更像B
- exercise responsibility 行使责任
- a good deal 非常，多得多
- overburdened 不堪重负的
v2: 从中产家庭的视角来看，这一切看起来不那么像行使更多财务责任的机会，而更像一个令人恐惧的加速---- 财政风险大规模转移到他们本就不堪重负的肩膀

转述

```
From the middle-class family perspective, this is not an opportunity to exercise more responsibility , but rather a frightening acceleration shifting the financial risk whosale onto their overburdened shoulders.

```
wholesale shift --- relentlessly shift
From the their perspective----As far as they are concerned,

**"Middle-class families do not see this as an opportunity. Rather, they see it as a frightening acceleration of a trend where policymakers are shifting the entire financial risk onto their already overburdened shoulders."**

Both the absolute cost of healthcare and the share of it borne by families have risen-and newly fashionable health-savings plans are spreading from legislative halls to Wal-Mart workers, with much higher deductibles and a large new dose of investment risk for families' future healthcare.
分析 both the cost and the share  borne by familiys    （主语）   have risen (这个and是什么补充？) 到这一个完整句子似乎完了。    - 好像另起了一个新句子：saving plans are spreading from .. to ...  with是修饰

v1:   家庭们同时忍受着医疗的所有花费和（share？）  ，这种现象已经增强了，（risen？）包括（时尚健康？？）也是一样的，伴随着越来越高的可扣费的（看不懂这）、庞大投资风险的家庭未来医疗机制，  上至政府法律机构人员下至沃尔玛超市员工，都开始有存钱计划，

Just as bosses and boards have finally sorted out their worst accounting and compliance troubles, and improved their feeble corporation governance, a new problem threatens to earn them -- especially in America -- the sort of nasty headlines that inevitably lead to heads rolling in the executive suite: data insecurity.
分析:  从句 bosses and  boards sorted out their worst accounting and compliance troubles   /  并列sort   : improve governance  真正的主句是  a new problem threatens to earn them？    nasty headlines 是threaten的同位语   
v1： 当老板和董事会最终梳理他们账单上最糟糕的麻烦（compliance怎么翻译？我怎么感觉如果compliance是个动词就能和sort并列，就通顺了呢）， 并且试图改善他们能力低下的公司治理时，（前半句太中式英文了，怎么还是这样，如何改进）  一个新的问题让他们吃惊（earn ?) 尤其是这个问题还发生在美国，这是有点吓人的，在这间高级套房能让所有人都过来关注的头条：数据风险。
- **标准版：** 正当老板和董事会最终解决了他们最棘手的会计与合规麻烦，并改善了其孱弱的公司治理之时，一个新的问题却很可能给他们——尤其是在美国——招致那种不可避免地会导致高管层人头落地的负面头条：数据不安全。
    
- **更流畅的意译版：** 企业高管们前脚刚从财务造假与监管合规的泥潭中脱身，孱弱的公司治理也稍有起色，后脚一个新问题便接踵而至。这个问题——数据不安全——很可能让他们（尤其在美国）再度登上负面头条，而这类新闻的出现，几乎注定要以高管的引咎辞职收场。、

- accounting  and compliance troubles
- feeble corporation governance
- earn sb sth
- lead to heads rolling
- in the executive suite

转述：
