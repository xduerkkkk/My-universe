Surely it should be obvious to the dimmest executive that trust, that most valuable of economic assets, is easily destroyed and hugely expensive to restore- and that few things are more likely to destroy trust than a company letting sensitive personal data get into the wrong hands.
分析: be obvious that 应该是主句？  that 后面是主语  应该是 trust is easily destroyed and expensive to restore     and    that few这个和前面trust is 并列？   中间的that most valuable of economic assets,只是trust的同位语     letting sensitive是company的修饰
v1: 对不被看好的行政部门来说，很显然的是，信任，这个在经济财产里最贵重的东西，是很容易被摧毁，也是很难去存储的，  且相对而言，没有什么比让敏感的私人数据流入不怀好意人手里（wronghand？）更容易摧毁信任的了。


- **标准版：** 当然，即便是对于最愚钝的高管来说，以下两点也本应是显而易见的：第一，信任——这一所有经济资产中最宝贵的财富——极易被摧毁，且恢复起来代价极其高昂；第二，没有什么比一家公司让敏感个人数据落入不法分子之手，更可能摧毁信任的了。
    
- **更流畅的意译版：** 一个连最愚笨的管理者都该明白的道理是：信任，作为最珍贵的经济资产，毁掉它轻而易举，重建它却代价高昂。而要说到摧毁信任的“最佳”方式，恐怕莫过于让敏感的个人数据落入别有用心者之手了。

- the dimmest executive 最愚笨的高管
- the most valuable of economic assets **在经济财产里最贵重的东西**
-  hugely expensive 是“极其昂贵的”。
- get into the wrong hands 是一个固定习语，意思就是“**落入不法分子之手；落入坏人手中**

Meanwhile. the theft of information about some 40 million credit-card accounts in America, disclosed on June 17th, overshadowed a hugely important decision a day earlier by America's Federal Trade Commission(FTC) that puts corporate America on notice that regulators will act if firms fail to provide adequate data security.
分析：主干是  the theft  overshadow a decision
disclosed 修饰的是information？ 
puts corporate America on notice 修饰FTC

v1: 同时，伴随着6月17号揭露的新闻：四千万美国信用卡账户失窃， 一个来自FTC的重大决定在今天早些时候来临（不知道怎么描述overshadow）， 这个决定警告了各美国公司（notice能这么用？） ，如果各公司仍不能对数据提供充分保护，监管人员将采取行动
1. **口头重组（人话版）：** “与此同时，发生了一件大事。6月17号那天，新闻披露了美国大约4000万个信用卡账户信息被盗。这个新闻的动静太大了，以至于**完全盖过**了前一天（6月16号）美国联邦贸易委员会（FTC）发布的一个极其重要的决定的风头。那个决定是干嘛的呢？它**正式警告**了整个**美国企业界**：如果你们这些公司再不提供足够的数据安全保障，我们监管部门就要出手了。”
    
2. **书面化输出（精修版）：**
- **标准版：** 与此同时，于6月17日披露的、关于美国约4000万个信用卡账户信息被盗的事件，为一天前美国联邦贸易委员会（FTC）的一项极其重要的决定蒙上了阴影。该决定旨在正式警告美国企业界：如果公司未能提供充分的数据安全保障，监管机构将采取行动。


A hugely important decision by America's FTC to put corporate America on notice  that the regulators would intervene  when data security is not provided adequately would  have caught more attention ,   if the theft  of information about some 40 million credit-card accounts in America had not been disclosed on June 17th

**Had the massive theft of 40 million credit-card accounts not been disclosed on June 17th, a hugely important decision by the FTC from the previous day would likely have garnered far more public attention. This decision was essentially a warning to corporate America: regulators would intervene if adequate data security was not provided**

"Their capacity for tolerating stress may even be greater than men's,” she observes, “it's just that they're dealing with so many more things that they become worn out from it more visibly and sooner."
分析：后面句子，第一个that是强调句？ 第二个that是 things的同位语从句
v1: 她观察到，他们忍受压力的能力甚至比男性还强， 仅仅因为他们做如此多显然会让他们筋疲力尽的事，
1. **口头重组（人话版）：** “她评论说啊：‘女性忍受压力的能力，甚至可能比男性还强。**只不过问题在于**，她们平时需要处理的事情**实在是比男性多太多了**，所以她们因此而表现出的那种疲惫感，才**更明显、也来得更快**罢了。’”
2. **标准版：** “她们忍受压力的能力甚至可能比男性的更强，”她评论道，“只不过她们需要应对的事情实在太多，以至于她们因此而表现出的疲惫才更明显、也更迅速。”
- capacity for (doing) sth 做某事的能力
- worn  out 筋疲力尽的

It's not that women's capacity for tolerating stress is worse than men's, but that they juggle many more things exhuasting themselves apparently and rapidly . The truth is that their tolerance may even better.

1. **met many more things**: meet在这里不够地道。表示“处理、应对”的动词有哪些？
    
    - **工具：** handle, manage, take on, juggle (同时处理多件事)。


juggle multiple tasks（同时处理多项任务)
in face, the reality is, 

**"It's not that women's capacity for tolerating stress is less than men's, but rather that they often have to juggle so many more tasks, which exhausts them more apparently and rapidly. The reality is, their tolerance for stress may even be greater.**

The kinds of interpersonal violence that women are exposed to tend to be in domestic situations, by, unfortunately, parents or other family members, and they tend not to be one-shot deals.

分析： violence   tend to be in domestic situations   by  parents or other family members   and 又来一个主句 与violence主句并列？  但是they到底是指代violence还是这些family members？
v1:  女人受到的这种人际方面的暴力倾向于发生在家庭情况，很不幸地是由父母或其他家庭成员引起的，而且暴力不会只发生一次
- **标准版：** 女性所遭受的人际暴力，往往倾向于发生在家庭环境中，施暴者不幸地是父母或其他家庭成员；并且，这类暴力往往不是一次性的事件。
- **更流畅的意译版：** 针对女性的人际暴力，呈现出两大令人痛心的特征：其一，它多为“家丑”，施暴者往往是本该最亲近的父母家人；其二，它极少是“孤例”，受害者常面临持续的、反复的伤害。

Interpersonal violence against women is often characterized by tow features: first is its occurance in domestic situations and its perpetrators often being family members, second is  its recurring nature 

exposure--occurance

**"Interpersonal violence against women is often characterized by two key features. The first is its context: it typically occurs in domestic situations, with its perpetrators often being family members. The second is its pattern: it is rarely a one-shot deal, but rather has a recurring nature."**

Other models exist that are hybrids of these three, such as delayed open access, where journals allow only subscribers to read a paper for the first six months, before making it freely available to everyone who wishes to see it.
分析：主句就仅仅是models exist ，然后为什么跟that are？定语从句？ 为什么不跟在models后面    where引导了状语 
v1：其他模型是这三者的综合，比如延迟开放存取（这啥啊，没有上下文），且杂刊在像所有意愿读者开放之前，仅仅允许订阅者在前六个月读刊
- **标准版：** 还存在一些作为这三者混合体的其他模型，例如“延迟开放获取”模式，在该模式下，期刊只允许订阅者在头六个月阅读一篇论文，之后才将其免费提供给所有希望阅读的人。
- **更流畅的意译版：** 此外，亦不乏融合上述三种模式的“混合型”方案。以“延迟开放获取”为例，该模式允许学术期刊在论文发表后的半年内仅供付费订阅者阅览，保护期过后，再向所有公众免费开放。

Delayed open access,  a model hybridized of three, exists as a journal reading method -- after subscribers  read new paper published in first  six months ,then everyone wishing to see it  catches read opportunity freely .

Delayed open access, a hybrid of other three models, is a publishing model, which allows journals to restrict access to subscribes only for the first six months and then release it to the public.

Though typically about two inches taller now than 140 years ago, today's people- especially those born to families who have lived in the U.S. for many generations- apparently reached their limit in the early 1960s.

分析： people reach their limit in the early 1960s 
v1: 尽管很典型地比起140年前高了两英尺， 我们仍能明显感到今天的人们--尤其是出生在生活于美国的那一代人--在十九世纪60年代以及达到身高的极限，不能再长了

- for many generations 世代以来
- apparently 翻译为 显然地；似乎
- reach limit 达到极限
- typically 通常

- **标准版：** 尽管现在的人们通常比140年前高约两英寸，但如今人们的身高——尤其是那些出生于已在美国生活了数代人的家庭中的人们——显然在20世纪60年代初就已达到了极限。
    
- **更流畅的意译版：** 今人虽普遍比140年前的先辈高出约两英寸，但身高的增长似乎早已停滞。有迹象表明，如今人们的身高极限——特别是对那些在美国繁衍了数代的家族而言——早在20世纪60年代初便已触及。

The height of today's people is typically  two inches taller than 140 years ago, whereas it stop becoming taller today. There is one indication illustrate this that the generation borned to families living in the US   maintain their height since 1960s  without growth. 

The height of today's people is typically two inches greater than that of people 140 years ago, whereas the limit seems to have been reached from an indication.It inllustraed that hieght of people, especially for families who have lived in the U.S , has remained stable since the 1960s

**Although today's people are typically about two inches taller than those 140 years ago, there are clear indications that this growth has reached its limit. For example, the average height of Americans, especially those from families with deep roots in the U.S., appears to have remained stable since the early 1960s.**
