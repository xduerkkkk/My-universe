You can make comments, cite examples or use your personal experiences to develop your essay

With the increasing application of AI technology, there is a growing concern that it may negatively impact human creativity.However, in my opinion,  using AI technology wisely is imperative to suppress its negative impact.To achive this goal, priority should be given to the following aspects.
Firstly, applying AI technology in approtive aspect is of paramount importance.People tend to take creative activity with AI like writing, taking up proposal and solution.Whereas AI is more adoptble to deal the work spent much time but no more intelligence. Furthermore， people ought to cultivate the ability to think proactively. Instead of asking for AI with a brief question and waiting its response passively, it's nothing better to input your thinking of first step（初步的理解？). Faling to do so may result in dependence on AI  without creativity yourself.
In conclusion, people must priorize the proper work  chosen and input with own thought. If we use AI intellegently, the AI technology will be helpful less than negatively impact creativty

### 第二步：完整高分范文 (Clean Copy)

请大声朗读这篇修改后的版本，特别是加粗的词汇：

With the increasing application of AI technology, there is a growing concern that it may negatively impact human creativity. However, in my opinion, using AI technology wisely is imperative to **mitigate** its negative impact. To achieve this goal, priority should be given to the following aspects.

**Firstly, distinguishing the roles of humans and AI is of paramount importance.** Currently, some people tend to **delegate creative tasks**, such as writing and generating proposals, entirely to AI. However, AI is technically more suitable for handling **repetitive and mundane tasks** rather than replacing human **ingenuity**. Therefore, it is vital for us to use AI as an assistant to improve efficiency, while keeping the core creative work in our own hands.

**Furthermore, people ought to cultivate the ability to think proactively.** Instead of inputting **vague queries** and waiting passively for answers, users should **incorporate** their own **preliminary understanding** and **initial insights** into the dialogue with AI. **Failing to do so may result in an over-dependence on technology and a gradual loss of independent creativity.**

In conclusion, people must prioritize **human-led interaction** with technology. If we use AI intelligently, it will serve as a **catalyst** for creativity rather than a killer.

Simp==ly== as the topic is ,its significance could not to be underestimated. 
Firstly, the transportation way of low carbon emission is the cornerstone of evironment protection. Based in big data, more transportation like subway, byscle, electonic car contributes lots to reduction of global temperature.It proves that environmentally friendly transporatation way acts as a decisive factor.
Futhermore, another key aspect lies in taking care in environment nearby.One small thing is that put your rubbish into dustbin instead of grass or road.

In conclusion, based on the discussion above, I firmly believe that  environmentaly lifestyle equires our utmost attention.  Only by keeping environmental consciouness, can we ensure that the future of our society will be promising and brilliant.


**Nowadays more and more people choose to live an environmentally friendly lifestyle.** With the rapid development of society, the phenomenon of **green living** has become a recurrent focus of public concern. It is therefore imperative that we take it seriously.

**Simple** as the topic is, its significance cannot be **underestimated**.

**Firstly, [adopting low-carbon transportation] is the cornerstone of environmental protection.** (把你具体的交通工具上升为“低碳交通”)  
Take myself as an example. If I had **persisted in driving a private car**, I would never have **contributed to the reduction of carbon emissions**. This proves that **[individual choice]** acts as a decisive factor.  
Many people tend to **confine themselves to [comfort and convenience]**, whereas the reality demands **[sustainable development]**.  
Therefore, it is vital for us to seize every opportunity to **[choose public transport or cycling]**. (把具体的动作放在最后)

**Furthermore, another key aspect lies in [cultivating good daily habits].** (把你扔垃圾的例子上升为“日常习惯”)  
One small thing is **garbage sorting**. Instead of **relying passively on [others to clean up]**, we should **proactively [reduce waste and recycle resources]**. (用“减少浪费”替换“扔垃圾”，更高级)  
In this competitive era, failing to do so may result in unwanted consequences, **such as deteriorating living environments.**

**In conclusion, based on the discussions above, I firmly believe that [an eco-friendly lifestyle] requires our utmost attention.** We should take the essence and discard the dregs.
