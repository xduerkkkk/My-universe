#### **第一段：开头 (看题型，三选一)**

- **【情况A：引言/谚语类】**

- **【情况B：图画/图表类】**

#### **第二段：分析与论证 (Why + How 混合双打)**

(这是拿分核心，逻辑是：先说它为什么重要/举例，再说我们该怎么做)

> **Simple as the topic is, its significance cannot be underestimated.**
> 
> **Firstly, [核心词/做法A] is the cornerstone of personal growth.** Take myself as an example. If I had failed to **[do A]**, I would never have been able to **[achieve my goals]**. This proves that **[核心词]** acts as a decisive factor. However, many people tend to **confine themselves to [旧习惯/现状]**, whereas reality demands **[新要求]**. Therefore, it is vital for us to **seize every opportunity to [具体的行动A]**.
> 
> **Furthermore, another key aspect lies in [做法B/某种能力].** In this competitive era, failing to **[do B]** may result in **unwanted consequences**. Instead of **relying passively on [旧方法/运气]**, we should **proactively [具体的行动B]**.

#### **第三段：总结 (万能结尾)**

> **In conclusion, based on the discussions above, I firmly believe that [Topic] requires our utmost attention.** **We should take the essence and discard the dregs.** Only by **working and studying diligently**, can we ensure that the future of our society will be **promising and brilliant**.
