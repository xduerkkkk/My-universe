#### **第一段：开头 (看题型，三选一)**

- **【情况A：引言/谚语类】**
    
    > The statement "**[抄题目名言]**" has recently sparked a heated discussion. Simple as it sounds, it conveys a profound truth: **[用简单句解释一下意思]**. To my understanding, it serves as a wake-up call that **[你的核心观点: e.g. innovation]** is the key to success.
    
- **【情况B：图画/图表类】**
    
    > As is vividly depicted in the cartoon, **[描述图片: e.g. a man is struggling to...]**. The caption reads: "**[图片上的字]**". This picture intends to inform us that **[你的核心观点]** is of great significance.
    
- **【情况C：现象/话题类】**
    
    > With the rapid development of society, the phenomenon of **[题目话题]** has become a recurrent focus of public concern. It is therefore imperative that we take it seriously.
    （应该可以写的更具体，比如 It is therefore imperative that they proactively plan for their carees and cultivate practical experience？）   要不要加To cope with this trend, priority should be given to the following two aspects 

---

#### **第二段：分析与论证 (Why + How 混合双打)**

(这是拿分核心，逻辑是：先说它为什么重要/举例，再说我们该怎么做)

> **Simple as the topic is, its significance cannot be underestimated.**

首先，A，它很重要/它是xx的核心。{   **以我为例子/以大数据为例子，如果没做好xx 就永远不会实现xx   。（我突然感觉，有点和后面重复，这又是举反例，？）    这证明A是关键因素；   然而，许多人固守xx现状， 但现实需要xxx。**}   *我感觉这中间也不需要模板，就是举例子？*    因此 it is vital for us to 做xxx 

> **Firstly, [核心词/做法A] is the cornerstone of personal growth.** （或者，直接is of paramount importance可以吗） Take myself as an example. If I had failed to **[do A]**, I would never have been able to **[achieve my goals]**. （或者换为，Based on empirical data,  peoplexxx？ )   This proves that **[核心词]** acts as a decisive factor. However, many people tend to **confine themselves to [旧习惯/现状]**, whereas reality demands **[新要求]**. Therefore, it is vital for us to **seize every opportunity to [具体的行动A]**.


进一步，另一个关键点在于xx。   不是做xx（举反例），而是做xx（正例）  。  如果没做到会引发不好的后果  （可以具体说后果是啥） 
> **Furthermore, another key aspect lies in [做法B/某种能力].**Instead of **relying passively on [旧方法/运气]**, we should **proactively [具体的行动B]**. In this competitive era, failing to **[do B]** may result in **unwanted consequences**. 

---

#### **第三段：总结 **

> **In conclusion, based on the discussions above, I firmly believe that [Topic] requires our utmost attention.** **We should take the essence and discard the dregs.** （这句话好怪，取其精华去其糟粕，不万用啊）  Only by **working and studying diligently**, （这也不适应，这应该改为对文章描述的行为的总结）  can we ensure that the future of our society will be **promising and brilliant**.

#### **第一段：引入 (万能现象/话题)**

> With the rapid development of society, the phenomenon of **[题目话题]** has become a recurrent focus of public concern. It is therefore imperative that we take it seriously. **To cope with this trend, priority should be given to the following aspects.**  
> (你加的这句过渡句非常好，保留！)

- **注：** 如果想写得更具体，把 take it seriously 换成 take proactive measures (采取积极措施) 也是万能的。

#### **第二段：分析与行动 (Why + How)**

> **Firstly, [做法A/核心词] is of paramount importance.**  
> (用你喜欢的这个词，完全没问题！)
> 
> **Take myself as an example.** If I had failed to **[do A: e.g., keep learning]**, I would never have been able to **[achieve my goals]**. This proves that **[核心词]** acts as a decisive factor.  
> (这里保留“以我为例”，因为虚拟语气 If I had failed..., I would never have... 是严重的加分项，比编造假数据更安全、更显语法功底。)
>Many people confine themselves to xxx  whereas the reality demands xxx
> 
> **Therefore, it is vital for us to seize every opportunity to [具体的行动A].**

> **Furthermore, another key aspect lies in [做法B/某种能力].**
> 
> Instead of **relying passively on [旧方法/运气]**, we should **proactively [具体的行动B]**. In this competitive era, failing to **[do B]** may result in **unwanted consequences**, such as **missed opportunities or failure**.  
> (把后果稍微具体化一点点，万能搭配：错失良机或失败)

---

#### **第三段：总结 (已修正为真正的万能版)**

> **In conclusion, based on the discussions above, I firmly believe that [Topic] requires our utmost attention.**
> 
> **It is high time that we took immediate action.** (用这个万能句替换“精华糟粕”，绝对不出错)
> 
> Only by **doing so / putting these measures into practice**, can we ensure that the future of our society will be **promising and brilliant**.  
> (用 doing so 替换“努力学习”，适合任何话题)
