now, sitting on my chair, face to my 笔记本电脑，
tired and  feelings from all directions  come with me.
I must have hard detimination to achive my goals
yeah, its exhuasting though i just study 3 hours
but it is not enough
i should find way to both study and relax 
i cant stop my going step

sitting at my desk, facing my laptop, i feel overwhelmed by mixed emotion/mixed feelings overwhelm me. Three hours of studying already left me exhausted ,yet I know it's not enough
My goals demand stronger determination -- I can't afford to pause now. Tiredness clings to me like a shadow, but my dreams are brighter. Well, i need strive for balance between studying and relaxing.
