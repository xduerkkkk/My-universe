As is illstrauted in graph, the projected trend of in the proportion of global births across major nations from 2023 to 2100 reveal significant demographic shifts.
India is expected to dominate initially (India is anticipated to lead), contributing over 18% of global briths by 2023, though its share will gradually decline to around 12% by 2100. In contrast Nigeria's proportion is projected to surge steadily, surpassing india by the 2-70s and reaching approximately 16% by 2100. China's contribution will drop sharply from 10% to below 4%, reflecting its aging population and low fertility rates. Pakistan and Indonesia will maintain moderate shares (4–6%), while the US remains stable at 3–4%. Russia’s proportion will stay minimal (<1%). These shifts underscore Africa’s rising demographic influence and Asia’s gradual decline, reshaping global population dynamics.
